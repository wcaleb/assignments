Homework \#3: Using and Understanding MALLET
============================================

HIST 318, Dr. McDaniel\
Due Monday, February 3, 3 p.m.

Introduction
------------

For our [January 31
class](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu/syllabus/#january-31), you
read several articles about using a method called "topic modeling" to
"read" texts algorithmically. In this homework assignment, you will have
a chance to use [MALLET](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu), a topic modeling
software package, yourself and then write a reflection on your
experience that applies what you have learned to our class project.

Before You Begin
----------------

This assignment will require you to use the command line on your
computer. I recommend that before you begin, you review some of the
material on this that we covered in class on Friday.

If you have a Mac or Linux machine, the [Command Line
Bootcamp](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/tutorials/bash/) from the
Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia is a useful place to begin,
and it is aimed at humanities students and scholars. If you have a
Windows machine, [here is a basic introduction to the DOC
prompt](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm).

Regardless of your machine, there are three main things you will need to
be able to do in this assignment from the command line, so make sure you
understand how to do each of them:

-   See what directory you are currently in.
-   Change directories.
-   List the contents of the current directory.
-   See inside the contents of a file.

You may also want to know how to clear your terminal screen if it
becomes too crowded with text. You can do this with the command `cls` at
the Windows command prompt and the command `clear` at the Unix/Mac
command line. (Even after clearing the screen, you should be able to
scroll up in your terminal windows to see what you've done in the past.)

Objectives
----------

1.  To gain a basic familiarity with the command line.
2.  To install and use MALLET with the sample data included in the
    package.
3.  To reflect on the uses and limitations of topic modeling in
    historical research.
4.  To gain experience and confidence in following a detailed tutorial
    for an unfamiliar tool.

Requirements
------------

There are both technical and non-technical requirements for this
assignment, but the two parts are separable. I recommend that you
attempt the technical part first since it will probably take longer, but
if you get stuck, you should be able to answer the questions in the
non-technical part before completing the techy stuff.

### Technical Requirements

Complete the tutorial on [Getting Started with Topic Modeling and
MALLET](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet)
at the Programming Historian, which will show you how to install MALLET
and then use it on the sample documents included with the package.

This requirement will be completed when you **tweet two screenshots of
your work** to the course hashtag `#ricedh`. More specifically:

-   One screenshot should, like Figure 8 in the tutorial, show the
    output of a `train-topics` command on the sample data set discussed
    in the tutorial, but should show that you generated **15 topics**
    instead of the default 10.
-   One screenshot should, like Figure 10 in the tutorial, show a
    screenshot of the `tutorial_composition.txt` file generated by your
    15-topic model opened in Excel. (If you don't have Excel installed
    on your computer, you can also satisfy this requirement by creating
    a GitHub Gist containing the contents of your
    `tutorial_composition.txt` file and tweeting the link to the Gist
    instead.)

If you are not familiar with how to take screenshots on your computer,
do some Googling to find out the answer, or ask on Twitter for help. You
will also need to learn [how to post photos on Twitter]().

### Non-Technical Requirements

After reading the Friday texts about topic modeling and trying out
MALLET yourself, you should be able to figure out answers to the
following two questions:

1.  Suppose we wanted to create a topic model of the runaway slave ads
    we have collected on our Google Spreadsheet. What first steps would
    we have to take to get from our spreadsheet of permalinks to a
    `*.mallet` file that we could train topics on?
2.  In his [Mining the
    Dispatch](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/pages/intro) project,
    Robert K. Nelson used MALLET to find articles that were likely to be
    [fugitive slave
    ads](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/Topics/view/15) in a large
    corpus of digitized newspapers. What feature(s) of the Portal to
    Texas History would have prevented us from using the same method to
    discover ads in the *Telegraph and Texas Register*? Be as specific
    and thorough as possible. (Here's a hint: do some searching for
    keywords in the *Telegraph and Texas Register* on the Portal, and
    notice what kinds of results you get back. Does the kind of result
    returned by a keyword search tell you something about the way that
    the underlying text documents in the Portal are stored and separated
    from each other?)

Write up an [email to me](mailto:wcm1@rice.edu) answering *both* of
these questions. You should be able to answer them with just a few
sentences in each case---no more than two good-sized paragraphs should
do the job.

Summary and Evaluation
----------------------

Successful completion of this assignment will include:

-   Two screenshots posted to Twitter to satisfy the technical
    requirements.
-   An email to me answering the two non-technical questions.

Because this assignment has several, separable part, I will divide up
the points for the assignment this way when evaluating your homework:
two points for each screenshot, and three points for each answer in the
email.

Help! I'm Stuck!
----------------

There is a good possibility you'll encounter technical difficulties when
doing this assignment. Don't fret or bang your head against the wall all
weekend if you are getting an error message that is not mentioned in the
tutorial, or if you are having trouble getting the same results shown in
the tutorial. Instead, get help!

You can always take to Twitter if you need help. If you are getting
error messages in your terminal that are longer than 140-characters or
difficult to explain, you can also use a Gist, as you did in [the first
homework](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu/2014/01/17/homework-1-the-anatomy-of-an-ad/),
to get help. Copy and paste the strange output of your terminal into a
Gist, putting an explanation of what produced it in the Gist
"description," and then tweet the URL to that Gist to our course hashtag
to see if I or another student can help. (And remember, helping out
other students is a way to score well on the Team Participation part of
your grade.)

Remember, though, the [academic integrity
policies](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu/2014/01/17/academic-integrity-policies/)
for the course. Do not get someone else to do the work for you and be
sure to acknowledge any pointers or technical assistance you
received---in this case by noting it in your email to me.
